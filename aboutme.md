title: About me
---

My name is Some Aditya Mandal. 
I am a Data Scientist, I tell stories with data and design intelligent solutions. 

In Our Tandem, I am currently working on Product Data Analytics using different technologies such as SQL, Python & Microsoft Power BI and building new Intelligent Solutions for the existing product using Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning. 

In 2018, I completed my MSc in Computer Science (Intelligent Systems) from the School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin. During the course of studies, I gained in-depth knowledge about the fundamentals of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I was actively involved in several academic projects such as Semantic Analysis of Yelp Dataset, Terrorism Data Visualisation, Real Time Dublin City Transportation dashboard, Adaptive News Application etc. I further developed an interest in Neural Machine Translation and submitted my thesis on "Neural Machine Translation for English to Hindi in Tourism Domain", under the supervision of Dr. Kevin Koidl for the fulfilment of the degree.

Between 2015-2016, i worked as an Associate Professional Application Delivery in Computer Sciences Corporation (now DXC Technology), India, for 1.2 yrs which gave me huge exposure to the IT Industry. 

Back in 2014, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi, India. The undergraduate curriculum introduced me to a wide variety of engineering subjects and provided me with a strong footing in the theoretical concept of Computer Science and Engineering.
